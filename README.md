# Let's Rock, Pape, Scissors!

This is a fun, basic website which provides a game of rock, paper, scissors. 
The user will be provided with an easy to play game against player (user) and the computer. 
The HTML and CSS code will allow for friendly/easy to use navigation with a simple header, Divs, images and footer. 
It is intended primarily for parents with children that are developing their decision making capabilities. 
For this purpose i intend on creating an exciting mix of foreground and background colours that will help with the games purpose. 
The context on the page will also be very basic so not to confuse the user.
